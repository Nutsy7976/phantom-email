    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: {% now 'local', '%B %d, %Y' %} </p>

    <p>Welcome to <strong>Phantom</strong> ("Service", "we", "us"). We are committed to user privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our enhanced privacy email service. Our goal is to minimize data collection and retention while providing the Service effectively and securely.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Process</h2>
    <p>Due to the nature of the Service (no user accounts), we process limited information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User-Provided Information:</strong> When you use the Service, you provide:
            <ul>
                <li>Recipient email address</li>
                <li>Subject line</li>
                <li>Message body</li>
                <li>Optional file attachments</li>
                <li>"From Name" (fictitious sender name)</li>
                <li>"From Email" (used to set the Reply-To address)</li>
            </ul>
            This information is processed solely to facilitate the sending of your email.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Payment Information:</strong> Payment processing is handled by our third-party provider, <strong>Stripe</strong>. We do not directly receive or store your full credit card number. Stripe provides us with confirmation of payment success or failure, which may include transaction IDs or masked card details relevant for processing refunds or investigating payment issues. Please review <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stripe's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Temporary Storage Data:</strong> To link your email details with payment confirmation, validated user-provided information (including message content and base64-encoded attachments) is stored temporarily in our Redis cache, associated with a unique transaction ID. This data is stored with a **Time-To-Live (TTL)** (typically around {{ TEMP_DATA_TTL.total_seconds() // 60 }} minutes, matching configuration) and is automatically deleted after successful processing via the Stripe webhook or upon TTL expiry, whichever comes first.</li>
        <li><strong>Technical Information (Minimal):</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>IP Address Hashing (for Rate Limiting):</strong> We may process a temporary hash of your IP address solely for the purpose of enforcing rate limits to prevent abuse. This hash is stored temporarily (e.g., for minutes or hours) and is not stored alongside message content or permanently logged in relation to specific emails sent.</li>
                <li><strong>Server Logs:</strong> Our web hosting provider (e.g., Render) may maintain standard server logs which might include IP addresses, request times, and browser types for operational and security purposes. We do not actively correlate these logs with specific email content or user identities. These logs are subject to the hosting provider's retention policies.</li>
                <li><strong>CAPTCHA Data:</strong> If you interact with a CAPTCHA service (e.g., hCaptcha) on our site, that service processes data according to its own privacy policy to distinguish humans from bots. We receive only a success/failure token from the CAPTCHA provider.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>We do NOT intentionally log or store the content of your emails or attachments long-term after they have been processed for sending.</strong></p>


    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>We use the processed information solely for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>To Provide the Service:</strong> To accept your email details, process your payment, and transmit your email to the intended recipient via our Transactional Email Service (TES) provider.</li>
        <li><strong>To Process Payments:</strong> To interact with Stripe for payment authorization and confirmation.</li>
        <li><strong>For Security and Abuse Prevention:</strong> To implement rate limiting, perform basic content scanning for prohibited keywords or patterns, verify CAPTCHA challenges, and investigate potential violations of our Terms of Service.</li>
        <li><strong>For Service Operation and Debugging:</strong> To monitor service health, troubleshoot technical issues using minimal, anonymized logs where possible.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Temporary Email Data (Redis):</strong> As described above, email details are stored temporarily in Redis with a TTL (e.g., {{ TEMP_DATA_TTL.total_seconds() // 60 }} minutes) and are deleted upon successful processing or expiry.</li>
        <li><strong>Message Content Post-Transmission:</strong> Once your email is successfully handed off to our TES provider, Phantom does not retain the message content or attachments on its primary systems. The TES provider will have its own data handling and retention policies.</li>
        <li><strong>Payment Records:</strong> Payment transaction details are managed by Stripe according to their policies. We may retain minimal transaction references (like Stripe IDs) linked to processing status for operational purposes (e.g., verifying payment for support, if offered).</li>
        <li><strong>Server Logs:</strong> Standard server logs maintained by our hosting provider are subject to their retention schedules.</li>
        <li><strong>No Receipts Policy:</strong> To minimize data trails, we do not send email receipts or confirmations to senders or recipients. Your on-screen confirmation after payment (if applicable) and the successful processing indicated by the Service are your primary indicators.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We limit information sharing to the minimum necessary to provide the Service:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Stripe:</strong> Payment details are shared directly with Stripe for processing.</li>
        <li><strong>Transactional Email Service (TES) Provider:</strong> The recipient address, sender details (configured sending address and Reply-To), subject, message content, and attachments are shared with our TES provider (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun) for email delivery. They process data according to their own privacy policies.</li>
        <li><strong>CAPTCHA Provider:</strong> Data related to your interaction with the CAPTCHA widget is shared with the provider (e.g., hCaptcha).</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court order, subpoena). While we aim to collect minimal data, information linked to payment transactions (via Stripe) may be subject to legal requests. We will comply with lawful requests as required by the governing jurisdiction specified in our Terms of Service.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not sell or rent your information to third parties.</p>

    <h2>5. Security Measures</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect the information we process. This includes using HTTPS (TLS encryption) for data transmission, verifying Stripe webhook signatures, using secure methods for handling API keys, and employing security best practices in our application code. However, no internet transmission or electronic storage method is 100% secure.</p>

    <h2>6. Your Choices</h2>
    <p>Given the anonymous nature of the service (no accounts), your primary choice is whether or not to use the Service. You control the information you provide when composing an email.</p>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our Service is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age of consent in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

    <h2>9. Contact Us (Privacy Inquiries)</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: [Provide an Email Address, e.g., privacy@yourdomain.com - Be prepared to handle inquiries]. Please note that due to the nature of the service, our ability to respond regarding specific past uses may be limited.</p>
